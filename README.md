# Machine Learning in Python
Data analysis and machine learning with Python in JupyterLab using the iris dataset.

This project utilizes multiple scikit-learn classification algorithms to class the iris dataset. Cross validation scores and confusion matrices included for each algorithm.

Also includes an automated approach to running multiple algorithms in quick succession with scoring and comparisons.
